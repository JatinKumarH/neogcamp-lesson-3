    <h1>What Is Acid Rain</h1>
    <small>15 June 2021</small>
    <p>Acid rain,” like “global warming,” is a phenomenon whose very existence is disputed by some.  In fact, evidence of acid rain has been observed in industrialized cities around the world since the mid-1800s.  “Acid rain” describes the mixture of wet and dry deposits from the atmosphere which contain high amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids that result from both natural and man-made emissions.  Its effects on structures and homes are very real.  Inspectors can learn more about acid rain and its destructive signs on metal and stone components of the exteriors of homes. Acid rain is formed when the chemical precursors of nitric and sulfuric acids -- sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), respectively -- combine with natural sources of acidic particles, such as volcanoes and decaying vegetation.  When this mixture reacts with oxygen, water and other chemicals (including pollutants such as carbon dioxide), the result is acid rain, which can be carried by rain, and even snow, frost, fog and mist, which, in turn, runs off into soil and groundwater.
        
        According to the EPA, about two-thirds of all SO2 and one-quarter of the NOx emissions in the atmosphere in the U.S. result from power plants that burn fossil fuels (primarily coal), as well as vehicles and agricultural equipment that rely on gasoline.
        
         
        
        It is fair to say that any industrialized region with power plants that burn fossil fuels will show some wear on its surrounding structures from acid rain.  But buildings in arid regions are at greater risk because of dry deposition, in which acidic pollutants are present in gases, smoke and dust, which tend to stick to buildings, cars and other structures.  When it rains or snows, the subsequent wet deposition of nitric and sulfuric acids becomes even more acidic, which then washes into the soil and aquifers.
        
        
        
        The more obvious impacts of acid rain can be seen on particular types of stone, such as limestone and marble buildings, monuments, statues and headstones.  The weathering pits and canyons can obliterate the lettering and features of such structures to a brutal degree, depending on the type of stone and other environmental conditions.</p>
